\noindent The journey that led to the completion of this work would not have been possible without the love and support of my mother, Ofelia Candelaria, and my brother, Ed Ralph. I will never be able to repay their unwavering support and encouragement throughout. Their belief in me has been a constant source of motivation and strength. Moreover, their dedication and sacrificial efforts in their own fields offered examples of excellence which I will continue to strive to emulate. 

I extend my deepest gratitudes towards Sudhir Malik. His guidance and mentorship have been invaluable to me, and I hope to pay forward the support he has shown me to the next generation of high energy physicists. Furthermore, I am deeply grateful to Kevin Pedro, Gabriele Benelli and the LHC Physics Center (LPC) at Fermilab for their guidance. The expertice they shared was instrumental in the completion of this work and in my growth as a physicist. 

This work would not have been possible without the support of funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) through the grant PHY-2111134 ("Physics Beyond Standard Model with the CMS Pixel Detector") and the LPC's Guest \& Visitor Program which allowed me to conduct much of the work presented here at Fermilab. 

Finally, I wish to dedicate this work to the loving memory of Moti \& Shiba. I will forever cherish the pure love \& joy they brough into my life.
