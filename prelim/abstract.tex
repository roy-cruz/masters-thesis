Previous CMS searches for emerging jets (EMJs) produced by dark pion decays into standard model quarks have focused on confined dark sector models with a bi-fundamental scalar mediator and dark pion decays primarily within the tracker volume. Additional constraints on dark pion lifetime and mass, as well as mediator mass, have been set by a search for long-lived particle (LLP) showers in the muon system. However, EMJs produced by decays within the calorimeter remain relatively unexplored, marking a gap that can be effectively addressed in Run 3. This thesis presents results for trigger efficiency studies of anomaly detection and LLP triggers to assess their potential for enhancing sensitivity to EMJs beyond the tracker, as well as the prospects of exploring models with a neutral vector boson mediator.
