In this work, we consider an $SU(N_d)$ gauge group which extends the standard model gauge group to

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		G_{\text{SM}} \times SU(N_d).
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $N_d$ is the number of colors of the new gauge group, and $\mathcal{G}_{\text{SM}}$ is the standard model gauge symmetry. We assume there are $n_f$ Dirac fermions, singlets under $G_{\text{SM}}$, in the fundamental representation of this extension. We call these fermions dark quarks, and denote them as $Q_d$. This dark sector has a confinment scale of $\Lambda_d$, with a value approximating the dark mesons and baryons. The dark baryons have a conserved charge, the dark baryon number.
