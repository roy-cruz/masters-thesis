  abstract = {Results are presented from searches for the standard model Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 and 8 TeV in the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the LHC, using data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 inverse femtobarns at 7 TeV and 5.3 inverse femtobarns at 8 TeV. The search is performed in five decay modes: gamma gamma, ZZ, WW, tau tau, and b b-bar. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, gamma gamma and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3 +/- 0.4 (stat.) +/- 0.5 (syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.},

However, the SM's narrative is incomplete, as it conspicuously fails to account for several empirical phenomena that challenge our current understanding of particle physics. This review meticulously examines three paramount anomalies that elude SM predictions: the elusive nature of dark matter, the Higgs boson's anomalously low mass, and the intricate puzzle of neutrino masses. Through a critical analysis, it delves into the forefront of theoretical advancements proposed to bridge these gaps, notably the Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), Supersymmetry (SUSY), and the intriguing hypothesis of right-handed neutrinos. By synthesizing current research and theoretical models, this review not only elucidates these profound mysteries but also underscores the imperative for a more comprehensive and unified theory of particle physics, setting the stage for future discoveries and theoretical breakthroughs.},

Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values (|η| ⩽ 5) assuring very good hermeticity.

  abstract = {A search is performed for events consistent with the pair production of a new heavy particle that acts as a mediator between a dark sector and normal matter, and that decays to a light quark and a new fermion called a dark quark. The search is based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 16.1 fb\$\textasciicircum\{-1\}\$ from proton-proton collisions at \$\textbackslash sqrt\{s\} =\$ 13 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016. The dark quark is charged only under a new quantum-chromodynamics-like force, and forms an "emerging jet" via a parton shower, containing long-lived dark hadrons that give rise to displaced vertices when decaying to standard model hadrons. The data are consistent with the expectation from standard model processes. Limits are set at 95\% confidence level excluding dark pion decay lengths between 5 and 225 mm for dark mediators with masses between 400 and 1250 GeV. Decay lengths smaller than 5 mm and greater than 225 mm are also excluded in the lower part of this mass range. The dependence of the limit on the dark pion mass is weak for masses between 1 and 10 GeV. This analysis is the first dedicated search for the pair production of a new particle that decays to a jet and an emerging jet.},

  abstract = {In this work, we propose a novel search strategy for new physics at the LHC that utilizes calorimeter jets that (i) are composed dominantly of displaced tracks and (ii) have many different vertices within the jet cone. Such emerging jet signatures are smoking guns for models with a composite dark sector where a parton shower in the dark sector is followed by displaced decays of dark pions back to SM jets. No current LHC searches are sensitive to this type of phenomenology. We perform a detailed simulation for a benchmark signal with two regular and two emerging jets, and present and implement strategies to suppress QCD backgrounds by up to six orders of magnitude. At the 14 TeV LHC, this signature can be probed with mediator masses as large as 1.5 TeV for a range of dark pion lifetimes, and the reach is increased further at the high-luminosity LHC. The emerging jet search is also sensitive to a broad class of long-lived phenomena, and we show this for a supersymmetric model with R-parity violation. Possibilities for discovery at LHCb are also discussed.},

We find that in both the e+e- and the LHC cases the kinematic distributions of the visible particles can be significantly affected by the valley radiation. Without a proper understanding of such effects, inferred masses of "communicators" and of invisible particles can be substantially off.},

In this article we study a selection of such models, where the secluded group either contains a softly broken U(1) or an unbroken SU(N). In the Abelian case new \{\textbackslash gamma\}v gauge bosons can be radiated off and decay back into visible particles. In the non-Abelian case there will not only be a cascade in the hidden sector, but also hadronization into new \{\textbackslash pi\}v and \{\textbackslash rho\}v mesons that can decay back. This framework is developed to be applicable both for e+e- and pp collisions, but for these first studies we concentrate on the former process type. For each Abelian and non-Abelian group we study three different scenarios for the communication between the standard sector and the secluded one. We illustrate how to distinguish the various characteristics of the models and especially study to what extent the underlying gauge structure can be determined experimentally.},

Measurements of charged-particle multiplicity and transverse momentum densities at various hadron collision energies are fit simultaneously to determine the parameters of the tunes. Comparisons of the predictions of the new tunes are provided for observables sensitive to the event shapes at LEP, global underlying event, soft multiparton interactions, and double-parton scattering contributions. In addition, comparisons are made for observables measured in various specific processes, such as multijet, Drell–Yan, and top quark-antiquark pair production including jet substructure observables. The simulation of the underlying event provided by the new tunes is interfaced to a higher-order matrix-element calculation.

The update is motivated by recent progress in methodology and available data, and involves both. On the methodological side, we now parametrize and determine the charm PDF alongside the light-quark and gluon ones, thereby increasing from seven to eight the number of independent PDFs. On the data side, we now include the D0 electron and muon W asymmetries from the final Tevatron dataset, the complete LHCb measurements of W and Z production in the forward region at 7 and 8 TeV, and new ATLAS and CMS measurements of inclusive jet and electroweak boson production. We also include for the first time top-quark pair differential distributions and the transverse momentum of the Z bosons from ATLAS and CMS. We investigate the impact of parametrizing charm and provide evidence that the accuracy and stability of the PDFs are thereby improved. We study the impact of the new data by producing a variety of determinations based on reduced datasets. We find that both improvements have a significant impact on the PDFs, with some substantial reductions in uncertainties, but with the new PDFs generally in agreement with the previous set at the one-sigma level. The most significant changes are seen in the light-quark flavor separation, and in increased precision in the determination of the gluon. We explore the implications of NNPDF3.1 for LHC phenomenology at Run II, compare with recent LHC measurements at 13 TeV, provide updated predictions for Higgs production cross-sections and discuss the strangeness and charm content of the proton in light of our improved dataset and methodology. The NNPDF3.1 PDFs are delivered for the first time both as Hessian sets, and as optimized Monte Carlo sets with a compressed number of replicas.},

  abstract = {A search for ``emerging jets'' produced in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is performed using data collected by the CMS experiment corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb\$\textasciicircum\{-1\}\$. This search examines a hypothetical dark quantum chromodynamics (QCD) sector that couples to the standard model (SM) through a scalar mediator. The scalar mediator decays into an SM quark and a dark sector quark. As the dark sector quark showers and hadronizes, it produces long-lived dark mesons that subsequently decay into SM particles, resulting in a jet, known as an emerging jet, with multiple displaced vertices. This search looks for pair production of the scalar mediator at the LHC, which yields events with two SM jets and two emerging jets at leading order. The results are interpreted using two dark sector models with different flavor structures, and exclude mediator masses up to 1950 (1850) GeV for an unflavored (flavor-aligned) dark QCD model. The unflavored results surpass a previous search for emerging jets by setting the most stringent mediator mass exclusion limits to date, while the flavor-aligned results provide the first direct mediator mass exclusion limits to date.},

  abstract = {In this work, we consider the case of a strongly coupled dark/hidden sector, which extends the Standard Model (SM) by adding an additional non-Abelian gauge group. These extensions generally contain matter fields, much like the SM quarks, and gauge fields similar to the SM gluons. We focus on the exploration of such sectors where the dark particles are produced at the LHC through a portal and undergo rapid hadronization within the dark sector before decaying back, at least in part and potentially with sizeable lifetimes, to SM particles, giving a range of possibly spectacular signatures such as emerging or semi-visible jets. Other, non-QCD-like scenarios leading to soft unclustered energy patterns or glueballs are also discussed. After a review of the theory, existing benchmarks and constraints, this work addresses how to build consistent benchmarks from the underlying physical parameters and present new developments for the PYTHIA Hidden Valley module, along with jet substructure studies. Finally, a series of improved search strategies is presented in order to pave the way for a better exploration of the dark showers at the LHC.},

Spectrographic images obtained with a photomultiplier tube on sensitized plates during 3-hour observations at the 4-m telescopes at Kitt Peak National Observatory and Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory were examined for Doppler-shift evidence of rotational velocity distribution across the visible disk of each galaxy. It was found that rotational velocity increases with radial distance from the galaxy center, a phenomenon best explained by a non-luminous spherical halo of matter extending beyond the visible galactic disk. This hypothesis can be seen as consistent with recent observations of the Milky Way, of AO 136-0801 (a faint galaxy consisting of a disk surrounded by a ring), and of pairs of galaxies. It is considered possible that such invisible galactic halos contain enough mass to increase the mass/luminosity ratio of the universe to near the 700 solar units theoretically necessary to brake the expansion of, or 'close', the universe.},

  abstract = {After a general introduction, in which some features of the density distribution and velocity distribution are discussed in connection with the possibifity that the galaxy may have a spiral-like structure, the author attempts in the third section to elucidate the relation between density distribution and distribution of peculiar velocities. It is shown that if the large-scale unevenness in density found in a recent study is accepted, it is natural to expect a deviation of the stream vertex from the longitude of the galactic center of similar order as the deviation actually observed. The distribution of light in the nearly spherical nebula NGC 44\textasciitilde 4 and in the strongly flattened elliptical nebula NGC 3115 has been investigated with the aid of plates taken by Dr. Oosterhoff with the 6o-inch reflector on Mount Wilson. The results, as shown in Table i and Figures 3 and 4, can be fairly well represented by Hubble's formula I = Io/(' + r/a)2, though some small but probably real deviations are indicated. The isophotes in NGC \textasciitilde{} i i5, of which a few typical ones are shown in Figure 5, deviate markedly from effipses and show remarkably sharp points at the equator. The ratio of the axes varies with the distance from the center; it has a minimum for a semimajor axis of i' (see Fig. 6). The space distribution of light in NGC \textasciitilde ii5 has been calculated; a section with isophotal surfaces is shown in Figure 7, while the run of space density in the equatorial plane may be found in the last column of Table i and in the dotted curve in Figure 4. The light density near the center is of the same order as that in the center of the globular cluster M \textasciitilde. In the last section these data are considered in relation to Humason's measures of the rotation of NGC 3115. It is found that beyond about io" from the center in the equatorial plane the mass density must be about constant. The actual density depends on the unknown flattening of the attracting mass, but it should be at least of the order of 140 solar masses per cubic parsec (io\textasciitilde{} gm/cm3), or 2000 times that near the sun. In this region of constant mass density the light-density diminishes with a factor of a},

Though the basic structure of the Run1 DQM system remains the same for Run2, between the Run1 and Run2 periods, the DQM system underwent substantial upgrades in many areas, not only to adapt to the surrounding infrastructure changes, but also to provide improvements to meet the growing needs of the collaboration with an emphasis on more sophisticated methods for evaluating data quality. We need to cope with the higher-energy and -luminosity proton-proton collision data, as well as the data from various special runs, such as Heavy Ion runs. In this contribution, we will describe the current DQM software, structure and workflow in the different environments. We then discuss the performance and our experiences with the DQM system in Run2. The main technical challenges which we have encountered and the solutions adopted during Run2 will also be discussed, including efficient use of memory in multithreading environments. Finally, we present the prospect of a future DQM upgrade with emphasis on functionality and long-term robustness for LHC Run3.},

To ensure that the recorded data has the best quality possible, the CMS Collaboration has dedicated Data Quality Monitoring (DQM) and Data Certification (DC) working groups. These working groups are made of human shifters and experts who carefully watch and investigate histograms generated from different parts of the detector. However, the current workflow is not granular enough and prone to human errors. On the other hand, several techniques in Machine Learning (ML) can be designed to learn from large collections of data and make predictions for the data quality at an unprecedented speed and granularity. Hence, the data certification process can be considered as a perfect problem for ML techniques to tackle. With the help of ML, we can increase the granularity and speed of the DQM workflow and assist the human shifters and experts in detecting anomalies during data-taking. In this presentation, we present preliminary results from incorporating ML to highly granular DQM information for data certification.},
